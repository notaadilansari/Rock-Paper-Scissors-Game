# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – Python OOP Project
A simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project is part of Python Winter Sprint 2026 – Core Track and focuses on class design, methods, and control flow.


📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
Understand classes and objects
Use __init__() for initialization
Apply if / elif / else logic
Work with loops and user input
Maintain and display game scores
This is not about fancy graphics — it’s about clean logic and correct OOP usage.


🧠 Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes & Objects
Instance variables
Methods
Conditional statements
Loops
Random module


🛠️ Features
✅ Player vs Computer gameplay
✅ Random computer moves
✅ Score tracking
✅ Multiple rounds
✅ Clear win / lose / draw results
✅ Final scoreboard display

🧩 How the Game Works
